The file "Leo's code.py" is the main python code that contains multiple optimisation methods we have attempted and the file "cleanFiles" cleans the temporary files created by the main code.In order for the main code to work,The python libraries are need: multiprocessing, os, subprocess, numpy,csv, time, scipy.optimize, pyswarm, scipy.interpolate, multiprocessing, matplotlib.pyplot. And Xfoil.exe has to be place in the same current working directory as the main code. 

The files "DE_Single_Object.py" and "DE_Multi_Object.py" are the codes that produce the results of single object and multi object aerofoil by differential evolution in the report.
